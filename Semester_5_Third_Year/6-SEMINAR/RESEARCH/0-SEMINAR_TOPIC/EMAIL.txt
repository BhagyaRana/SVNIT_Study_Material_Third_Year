Mukesh Sir,

I am Bhagya Rana, 3rd Year CSE Undergraduate at N.I.T., Surat.

I would Like to Work on "Image Cartoonification With Neural Network" Topic for SEMINAR Subject under Your Guidance, Since Your Area of Research are Computer Vision and Image Processing.

This Research will Mainly Deal with Transformation of Realistic Images and Videos into Cartoon Images and Video using GAN.

It will Include Processing of Loading the image, Compressing the Image [K means Clustering], Detecting Edges, Creating Edge Mask and Tranforming the Images.

Some References I read Regarding the Topic:

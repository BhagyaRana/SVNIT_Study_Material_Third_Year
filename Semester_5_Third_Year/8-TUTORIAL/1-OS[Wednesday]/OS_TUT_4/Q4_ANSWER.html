                        <h3>Question</h3>
                        <div class="question"><p>An OS has 110 MB available for user processes. The maximum memory requirement of a process for its own code and data is 20 MB, while the average memory requirement of a process is 10 MB. If the OS uses contiguous memory allocation and does not know sizes of individual processes, what is the average internal and external fragmentation?</p></div>
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <h2>Answer</h2>
                            <div class="answer"><p><span class="bold">Problem 12:</span> The OS creates 5 memory partitions of 20M bytes each. Hence external fragmentation is 10 M bytes. Each partition has average internal fragmentation of 10M bytes. Hence the total internal fragmentation is 50M bytes.</p></div>
